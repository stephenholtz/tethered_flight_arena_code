classdef Trial
    % Trial class holds a set of equal data instances and meta properties.
    % In the tethered flight case, there will only be one data instance, so
    % there is no computation needed, and a reference can pass down to data
    % for later computation.
    % 
    % Note:
    %   Any time there is only one 'data' object returned, it is propagated
    %   as a single object in a cell array.
    
    properties
        % All of these properties are used as containers in our class
        % structure. Their values may or may not need to be computed with
        % class methods, most of which should be called by the main
        % function. See methods for more information.

            % mapping, so rather than clog the database, they are just
            % directly referenced from the Experiment class.
