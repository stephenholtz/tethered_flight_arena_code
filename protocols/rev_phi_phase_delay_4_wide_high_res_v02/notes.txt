This version of reverse phi phase delay has circshifted position functions, instead of offsets. It has very high resolution for just one temporal frequency.

This is an attempt to nail down the source of the before vs after motion flicker asymmetry that has been observed in the 8 wide, 4 wide high res, and 4 wide version 1 reverse phi stimuli.

This protocol also has identical before and after timing offsets.
