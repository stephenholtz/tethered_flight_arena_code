% Grouped conditions file, specifies which conditions belong together in
% the form:
% Grouped conditions, cond2/4 = transformed to cond1/3, form below
% {[cond1_rep1... cond1_repN], [cond2_rep1... cond2_repN]; 
% [cond3_rep1... cond3_repN], [cond4_rep1... cond4_repN]}
%
% This file is used to hopefully automate comparisons later on
%

% This file is not really needed for this protocol....
