This reverse phi phase delay protocol is presented unilaterally in the front to back and back to front (cw and ccw for each).

Progressive / Regressive, cw/ccw, .75 Hz temporal frequency, 5 ms offsets for phase delay and regular motion at the two contrasts (one contrast for each part of the flicker).

This will hopefully be analogous to the high res reverse phi protocol that tested the polarity asymmetry sanity check.
